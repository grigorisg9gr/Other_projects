The purpose of the code is for competing in the Kaggle competition of "Facial Keypoint Detection". 
The instructions below describe a step by step process how to format the train/test data and how to run the Deformable Part Models (voc-release 5). 

1. Download train and test files and unzip them. 
2. In a terminal run: 
	a. cat training.csv | sed 'y/ /,/' > training_allcomma.csv
	b. cat test.csv | sed 'y/ /,/' > test1.csv
3. Delete the first row from both files.
4. Move the files training_allcomma.csv, test1.csv, IdLookupTable.csv in the data/ folder. Note: All these files can be found in the kaggle site. 


For running DPM: 
1. In DPM folder, edit voc_config(): change the var BASE_DIR in the home directory that DPM code is. 
2. Run demo_DPM to run the DPM code. If you do not wish to re-train the models from scratch, ask for the trained models.
